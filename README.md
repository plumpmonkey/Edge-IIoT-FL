# Workbooks to support Edge-IIoT FL training

 - Download the Edge-IIoT dataset from Kaggle [Edge-IIoTset Cyber Security Dataset of IoT & IIoT](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedamineferrag/edgeiiotset-cyber-security-dataset-of-iot-iiot)
 - Run the `01-data_prep_DNN.ipynb` notebook to prepare the data for the ML models. As per the guidance from the author, the DNN prep is suitable for DNN and ML.
 - `02-Baseline_model_testing.ipynb` notebook contains the baseline model testing. The baseline models are DT, RF, Knn and SVM to align with the original paper. MLPP and XGBoost are also tested.
